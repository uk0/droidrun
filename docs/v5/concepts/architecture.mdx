## What is Droidrun?

Droidrun uses a **multi-agent architecture** where specialized agents work together to complete tasks. Instead of one agent doing everything, different agents handle planning, execution, and computation.

```
DroidAgent (orchestrator)
├── Reasoning Mode: ManagerAgent → ExecutorAgent → ScripterAgent
└── Direct Mode: FastAgent
```

## Execution Modes

### Reasoning Mode (`reasoning=True`)
Manager creates plans, Executor takes actions. Best for complex multi-step tasks.

```
Goal → Manager (plan) → Executor (action) → Manager (check) → Executor (next) → ...
```

### Direct Mode (`reasoning=False`)
FastAgent executes immediately via XML tool-calling without planning overhead. Best for simple tasks.

```
Goal → FastAgent (XML tool-calling) → Done
```

## Core Agents

### DroidAgent (Orchestrator)
Main coordinator that routes between agents based on mode.

**Location**: `droidrun/agent/droid/droid_agent.py`

### ManagerAgent (Planner)
Creates strategic plans and breaks tasks into subgoals. Reasoning mode only.

**Location**: `droidrun/agent/manager/manager_agent.py`

**Workflow**: `prepare_context()` → `get_response()` → `process_response()` → `finalize()`

### ExecutorAgent (Actor)
Executes atomic actions for each subgoal. Reasoning mode only.

**Location**: `droidrun/agent/executor/executor_agent.py`

**Workflow**: `prepare_context()` → `get_response()` → `process_response()` → `execute()` → `finalize()`

### FastAgent (Direct Executor)
Uses XML tool-calling for device interaction. Direct mode only.

**Location**: `droidrun/agent/codeact/tools_agent.py`

**Available Actions**:
```python
click(index), long_press(index), type(text, index),
swipe(coordinate, coordinate2), system_button(button),
wait(duration), open_app(text), get_state(), take_screenshot(),
remember(information), complete(success, reason)
```

### ScripterAgent (Off-Device)
Executes Python for API calls, file operations, and computations. Triggered by Manager when needed.

**Location**: `droidrun/agent/scripter/`

## Configuration

Configure different LLMs per agent:

```yaml
llm_profiles:
  manager:
    provider: Anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4
  executor:
    provider: OpenAI
    model: gpt-4o
  fast_agent:
    provider: GoogleGenAI
    model: models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp
  scripter:
    provider: OpenAI
    model: gpt-4o

agent:
  reasoning: true       # Enable Manager/Executor workflow
  max_steps: 15         # Maximum execution steps (global)
  manager:
    vision: true        # Send screenshots to Manager
  executor:
    vision: true        # Send screenshots to Executor
  fast_agent:
    vision: false
    parallel_tools: true
    safe_execution: false
  scripter:
    max_steps: 10       # Scripter-specific max steps
    safe_execution: false
```

## When to Use Each Mode

**Use Reasoning Mode for:**
- Multi-step tasks (booking flights, configuring settings)
- Tasks requiring planning and adaptation
- Complex workflows across multiple apps

**Use Direct Mode for:**
- Simple actions (screenshots, sending messages)
- Fast execution without planning overhead
- Well-defined single-step tasks

## Shared State

All agents share `DroidAgentState` for coordination:
- Action history and outcomes
- Error tracking and recovery
- Memory and context
- Scripter results
- Current plan and progress

## Quick Reference

| Agent | Role | Best For | Mode | Config Key |
|-------|------|----------|------|------------|
| DroidAgent | Orchestrator | Entry point | Both | `agent.*` |
| ManagerAgent | Planner | Strategy, recovery | Reasoning | `agent.manager.*` |
| ExecutorAgent | Actor | Action execution | Reasoning | `agent.executor.*` |
| FastAgent | Direct | Simple tasks | Direct | `agent.fast_agent.*` |
| ScripterAgent | Python Executor | APIs, files, data | Reasoning | `agent.scripter.*` |
